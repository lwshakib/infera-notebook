## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **pnpm** 9.x or higher (recommended)
- **Node.js** 22.x or higher
- **PostgreSQL** 16+ database running locally or remotely
- **Git** installed and configured
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Familiarity with **React 19**, **Next.js 16**, and **Tailwind CSS 4**

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**

   ```bash
   # Click the "Fork" button on GitHub
   ```

2. **Clone your fork**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/infera-notebook.git
   cd infera-notebook
   ```

3. **Add the upstream repository**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/lwshakib/infera-notebook.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

6. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   pnpm run db:migrate
   ```

7. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

8. **Start Inngest dev server** (in a separate terminal)
   ```bash
   pnpm run inngest:dev
   ```

## Development Process

### Branch Naming Convention

Create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
# or
git checkout -b docs/your-documentation-update
```

Branch naming prefixes:

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or updates
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### Keeping Your Fork Updated

Regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Avoid using `any` type - use proper types or `unknown`
- Use interfaces for object shapes, types for unions/intersections
- Export types and interfaces that might be used elsewhere

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks (Server and Client Components)
- Use TypeScript for component props and return types
- Follow the existing shadcn/ui and Radix UI patterns
- Use meaningful component and prop names

**Example:**

```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

export function Button({ children, onClick, variant = 'primary' }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick} className={cn('button', variant)}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### File Organization

- Place components in appropriate directories
- Use index files for clean imports
- Keep related files together
- Follow the existing project structure

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase starting with `use` (e.g., `useAuth.ts`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_FILE_SIZE`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`)

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings (unless escaping)
- Use trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Comments

- Write self-documenting code when possible
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
- Use JSDoc comments for exported functions
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

**Example:**

```typescript
/**
 * Processes a source file and extracts text content.
 * Supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT formats.
 *
 * @param file - The file to process
 * @returns Promise resolving to extracted text content
 * @throws Error if file format is not supported
 */
async function processSourceFile(file: File): Promise<string> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Aim for meaningful test coverage
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Keep tests simple and readable

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `perf`: Performance improvements

### Examples

```bash
feat(notes): add audio overview generation
fix(chat): resolve citation display issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(sources): improve file processing logic
test(api): add tests for note creation endpoint
```

### Commit Best Practices

- Make small, focused commits
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- One logical change per commit
- Test your changes before committing
